This application was built as part of my Cloud Application Development module. I decided to make a dental office administration application where users are presented with full CRUD functionality allowing them to manage patients, manage patient records and finally manage appointments.

The application makes use of the devise gem which handles the login functionality within the application. As part of the project, we needed to deploy our application to a server. The server of choice this application is deployed on to is Heroku.
